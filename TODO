Short term
==========

* Playing against computer (UI integration)
* Demo mode (aka let computer's play against each other)
* Final results screen to display with full-flegded statistics when
  a game is over (aka ResultsScreen)


Long term
=========

* Ship further go board themes and own icons
* Save-game management (something similar to palapeli)
* Add multiplayer support via GGZ and traditional Go servers
* Cache longer lists retrieved from the backend in the GoEngine (for example
  move history, stone lists for either player, ...) to save computing time


Go engines
==========

These engines support the GTP protocol:

| Engine        | Command           |
|---------------|-------------------|

| Aya           | aya --mode gtp    |
| CrazyStone    | ?                 |
| Brown         | ?                 |
