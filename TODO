* Cache longer lists retrieved from the backend in the GoEngine (for example
  move history, stone lists for either player, ...) to save computing time

* Implement the Demo mode

* Add move controls to toolbar instead of undo / redo:
  First Move | Previous Move | Next Move | Last Move

* Ship further go board themes (two should be enough to show)

* Add multiplayer support via GGZ and traditional Go servers
