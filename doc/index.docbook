<!-- The contents of the documentation begin here.  Label
each chapter so with the id attribute. This is necessary for two reasons: it
allows you to easily reference the chapter from other chapters of your
document, and if there is no ID, the name of the generated HTML files will vary
from time to time making it hard to manage for maintainers and for the CVS
system. Any chapter labelled (OPTIONAL) may be left out at the author's
discretion. Other chapters should not be left out in order to maintain a
consistent documentation style across all KDE apps. -->

	<para>&kigo; is an open-source implementation of the popular Go game (also known as Weiqi).</para>
	<para>
	Go is a strategic board game for two players. It is also known as igo (Japanese), weiqi or wei ch'i (Chinese) or baduk (Korean). Go is noted for being rich in strategic complexity despite its simple rules.
	</para>

	<para>
	The game is played by two players who alternately place black and white stones (playing pieces, now usually made of glass or plastic) on the vacant intersections of a grid of 19×19 lines (9x9 or 13x13 lines for easier flavors).
	</para>

application that explains what it does and where to report
problems. Basically a long version of the abstract.  Don't include a
revision history. (see installation appendix comment) -->

	<para>When you have started &kappname; you have two options to play the wonderful game of Go. You can either start a new game or continue an old one.</para>

    <sect2 id="new_game">
    <title>Setup a new game</title>
      <para>
	When you have started &kappname; you should see a screen similar to the one shown in screenshot below. There you can set up both the white and the black player’s name and the board size. You can decide if one or both players should be computers. If you decide to play against a computer you can also set its strength. If you want to start the game you can either select <guimenuitem>Start Game</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Game</guimenu> menu, click on <guibutton>Start Game</guibutton> in the <quote>Game setup</quote> dock widget or by simply pressing the key <keycap>S</keycap>.

      </para>

      <para>
      Now you should see a screen similar to the one shown on the screenshot below. If you do not want to continue with the last move made, you can revert as many moves as you like. You should see the board changing as you change the current move number. The setup screen also presents a lot of additional information about the saved game.

      </para>

      <para>
      Making a move is simple, just click on one of the intersections on the Go board. You should see a little black point which shows you where your stone would land if you click.
      </para>

      <para>
      The current player can be determined by the cursor, which changes to a black or a white stone depending on which player is next.
      </para>

      <para>
      You can also check the game information which shows also the previous move and some statistics. A complete move history is also available. If you want to remember in which order the stones on the board where placed, just click the <guibutton>Show move numbers</guibutton> button. If you think that you can’t gain anything by placing another stone, just click <guibutton>Pass Move</guibutton> and let your opponent take his turn. If both players pass, the game can be ﬁnished. Note that ending a Go game is always a cooperative step!

      <listitem><para>On the 19x19 board there are typically several territories being created, attacked or defended.  You have to fight several battles simultaneously.

      <listitem><para>As the board fills up and the end-game approaches, it becomes important to play closer up, nibbling at your opponent's fences or reinforcing your own.  Small mistakes and omissions can become very costly.</para></listitem>

<!--This section describes configuration GUI. If your game is configured using menubar exclusively, please remove this section.-->
  <para>
  If you want to change how &kappname; is conﬁgured you can do that by navigating to the <guimenu>Settings</guimenu> menu and clicking on the <guimenuitem>Conﬁgure &kappname;...</guimenuitem> action.
  </para>

  <para>
  You should now see the conﬁguration dialog as shown in the screenshot below. You can reach it also by pressing the key combination <keycombo>&Alt;<keycap>S</keycap></keycombo> followed by <keycombo>&Alt;<keycap>C</keycap></keycombo>.
  </para>

  <para>
  &kappname; is extremely ﬂexible and can be customized as much as you like. You are able to change positions and size of all dock widgets next to the central play area. You can also customize the toolbar if you want to have diﬀerent actions accessible there. To do this just click on the <guimenu>Settings</guimenu> menu and choose <guimenuitem>Configure toolbars...</guimenuitem>. The same is possible for all shortcuts in the game. If you want to have the maximum space available for the game ﬁeld you can even hide the toolbar and most dock widgets in the <guimenu>Settings</guimenu> menu.
  </para>
  <sect1 id="genconig">
  <title>General Configuration</title>
    <para>
      The most important aspect here is the Go engine backend conﬁguration. &kappname; needs a valid backend to function properly. As you can see in the screenshot below, it used GnuGo by default. The little light next to the engine command shines green if everything works ﬁne. If this is not the case or if you want to use a diﬀerent Go backend, you should install a diﬀerent Go engine which can speak the GnuGo Text Procotol (GTP) and set its command and parameters accordingly. Details about this step should be found in the corresponding Go engine documentation.
